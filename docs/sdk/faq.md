# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Answers to common questions about LLM-CostOps.

## General Questions

### What is LLM-CostOps?

LLM-CostOps is an enterprise-grade cost operations platform for LLM infrastructure. It helps you track, analyze, and optimize costs across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS, and more) with production-ready accuracy.

### Is LLM-CostOps open source?

Yes! LLM-CostOps is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 / MIT. The core platform is fully open source and can be self-hosted.

### What's the difference between cloud and self-hosted?

| Feature | Cloud (Hosted) | Self-Hosted |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Setup | Instant | Manual deployment |
| Maintenance | Managed by us | You manage |
| Scalability | Auto-scaling | Configure yourself |
| Cost | Monthly subscription | Infrastructure costs only |
| Data Location | Our servers | Your infrastructure |
| Customization | Limited | Full control |

### Which LLM providers are supported?

Currently supported providers:
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- **Anthropic** (Claude 3 family)
- **Google Vertex AI** (Gemini, PaLM)
- **Azure OpenAI**
- **AWS Bedrock**
- **Cohere**
- **Mistral AI**
- **Custom providers** (you can add your own)

### How accurate are the cost calculations?

LLM-CostOps uses 10-decimal precision (rust_decimal) for accurate financial calculations. Costs are calculated based on:
- Exact token counts from provider responses
- Up-to-date pricing tables
- Support for tiered pricing and volume discounts
- Cached token discounts (where applicable)

### Can I track costs across multiple organizations?

Yes! LLM-CostOps supports multi-tenancy with organization-level isolation. Each organization has:
- Separate cost tracking
- Independent API keys
- Individual budgets and alerts
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## Pricing & Billing

### How much does LLM-CostOps cost?

**Cloud (Hosted):**
- **Free Tier**: Up to 1M tokens/month
- **Starter**: $29/month (10M tokens)
- **Professional**: $99/month (100M tokens)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing (unlimited)

**Self-Hosted:**
- Free (just infrastructure costs)
- Optional premium support available

### How is usage calculated?

LLM-CostOps tracks:
- **Input tokens**: Tokens sent to the LLM
- **Output tokens**: Tokens generated by the LLM
- **Cached tokens**: Tokens from prompt caching (if supported)
- **Total requests**: Number of API calls

Costs are calculated as:
```
cost = (input_tokens / 1000 * input_price) +
       (output_tokens / 1000 * output_price)
```

### Can I set spending limits?

Yes! You can set:
- **Organization budgets**: Total monthly spend limit
- **Project budgets**: Per-project spend limits
- **User budgets**: Per-user spend limits
- **Model budgets**: Per-model spend limits

Alerts can be sent at customizable thresholds (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%).

### What happens if I exceed my budget?

It depends on your configuration:
- **Soft limit**: You receive alerts but API continues working
- **Hard limit**: API requests are blocked when budget is exceeded
- **Rate limiting**: Requests are throttled after threshold

## Technical Questions

### Which programming languages have SDKs?

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **REST API**: Available now (works with any language)
- 🔄 **Python**: Planned
- 🔄 **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Planned
- 🔄 **Go**: Planned
- 🔄 **Java**: Planned

Until official SDKs are available, use the REST API directly (see [cURL examples](examples/curl/)).

### How do I track LLM usage automatically?

**Option 1: Manual Tracking**
```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)

# Track usage
cost_ops.usage.submit(
    organization_id="org-123",
    provider="openai",
    model_id="gpt-4",
    input_tokens=response.usage.prompt_tokens,
    output_tokens=response.usage.completion_tokens,
    total_tokens=response.usage.total_tokens
)
```

**Option 2: Middleware** (recommended)
```python
# FastAPI example
from llm_cost_ops.middleware import CostTrackingMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CostTrackingMiddleware,
    api_key=os.getenv("LLM_COST_OPS_API_KEY")
)
```

**Option 3: Proxy** (coming soon)
- Route all LLM requests through LLM-CostOps proxy
- Automatic tracking for all providers
- No code changes required

### Can I export my cost data?

Yes! Multiple export formats:
- **CSV**: For Excel, Google Sheets
- **JSON**: For custom processing
- **Excel (XLSX)**: With charts and pivot tables
- **JSON Lines**: For streaming/big data
- **Parquet**: For data warehouses

```bash
# Export to CSV
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/api/v1/costs/export?format=csv&start_date=2025-01-01&end_date=2025-01-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -o costs.csv
```

### How do I integrate with my existing tools?

- Tableau, Power BI, Looker: Use CSV/Excel export
- Metabase, Redash: Connect to PostgreSQL database (self-hosted)

**Monitoring:**
- Datadog, New Relic: Use Prometheus metrics endpoint

- Total cost (by period, provider, model, project)
- Average cost per request
- Cost per 1K tokens
- Cost trends over time

**Usage Metrics:**
- Total tokens (input, output, cached)
- Request count
- Average tokens per request
- Token distribution

**Performance Metrics:**
